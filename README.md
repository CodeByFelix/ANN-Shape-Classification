In this project, i trained a deep learning model using keras to predict basic shapes "Circle, Triangle and Square". I trained the model using 1200 images each of the shape having 400 images.

Each of the training image is a 28x28 pixel image making my preprocessed table of features to have 784 colums.

I trained the model using 4 networks, with the networks having 2048 neurons, 1024 neurons, 512 neurons and 64 neurons.

The model successfully trained for 50epochs, a graph of the accuracy, validation accuracy, and lose is shown below

The model perfomed prety good with 86% accuracy.
